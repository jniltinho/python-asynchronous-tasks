##  Setup & Installation 
Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start redis and rabbitmq services with `docker-compose`:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify that the services are up and running:
```
$ docker ps

# Excepted output
27d1b8ced89a   rabbitmq:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago   Up 8 minutes   4369/tcp, 5671/tcp, 15691-15692/tcp, 25672/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5672->5672/tcp, :::5672->5672/tcp   python-async-tasks_rabbitmq_1
17b72947fb8a   redis:latest      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago   Up 8 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp                                                   python-async-tasks_redis_1
```

## Usage
Spin up a new terminal and start the celery worker:
```bash
$ celery -A tasks worker -l info --pool=solo
```
Send a task to celery worker to verify that it's working as excepted:
Open a new terminal and get inside python interactive shell, import `say_hello` function from `tasks.py` and then call it with `delay()`

```python
$ python
>>> from tasks import say_hello
>>> say_hello.delay("Valon")
<AsyncResult: 5711efdc-17c7-4f02-bfba-d193c3d28c42>
```
And in the celery terminal that we started the worker before we should except a result similar to:
```
INFO/MainProcess] Received task: tasks.say_hello[5711efdc-17c7-4f02-bfba-d193c3d28c42]
INFO/MainProcess] Task tasks.say_hello[5711efdc-17c7-4f02-bfba-d193c3d28c42] succeeded in 5.01600000000326s: 'Hello Valon'
```

## What to do next?
Just expand the usage of the celery, define your tasks and keep doing amazing stuff :)
